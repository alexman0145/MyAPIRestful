## Step 4 :

For use the front end you can use the next prompt

``` bash
ng serve

Tap n if you decline this proposition

``` bash
Would you like to enable autocompletion? This will set up your terminal so pressing TAB while typing Angular CLI commands will show possible options and autocomplete arguments. (Enabling autocompletion will 
modify configuration files in your home directory.) (Y/n)
```
